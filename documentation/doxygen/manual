\section intro_sec Introduction

EPICS support module for the Qioptic Fetura Advanced Zoom Imaging System

The zoom module is an optical unit to be used at the sample position in the MX beamlines
at Diamond.
The zoom module control is via an RS-232 link.
When operating, the EPICS module regularly request the unit's status.
When a new position demand arrives, a 'zoom position' transmit instruction 
is sent and the status is read back.
Much of the structure of the module was derived from the modbus support module
by Mark Rivers.


This module aims at reproducing the functionality of the manufacturer's "Pulse" software
delivered with the unit.

\section epics_user_guide How to use the EPICS software
\subsection example_iocs Example IOCs

There are two example IOCs in the support module, that demonstrate how to build an IOC with the fzoom module.

\li The example 'fzoomExample' was prepared for a Linux PC.
\li The example ioc 'fzoomVx' was prepared for a vxWorks VME crate using a Hytec serial line.

There is also a script 'fzoomExampleGui' that will launch a GUI for either example IOC.

\subsection interface Interface PVs
To move the unit, assign a value to the following PV (from 0 to 100%):<br>
  \$(P)\$(R):ZOOMPOSCMD

There is a status value that can be read about when the unit reports being ready to acquire in PV<br>
   \$(P)\$(R):ACQUIRE

\subsection initialisation Initialisation

There are two templates to include for the IOC: fzoomCommand.template  and fzoomStatus.template

The initialization in the startup script uses the function call

drvFzoomAsynConfigure(<portname>,<octetPort>)

where 
\li portname is the new asyn port for the zoom module - to be used in the IOC templates, and
\li octetPort is the underlying serial line configured separately at initialisation.

\section known_problems Known Problems

\li At initialisation the device cannot determine its current position.

\li Documentation not up to date. See \ref documentation.

\section documentation Manufacturer documentation 
Here is a sharepoint link to the user guide for the zoom module unit:

<a href="http://diamdocs/sites/default/TECHNICAL%20DIVISION%20(TEC)/Controls%20and%20Interlocks%20CTRL/Supplier%20Documentation/Qioptic/FeturaDevManual-2.1.pdf">Zoom module Developer Guide V2.1</a>
<br>
<a href="http://diamdocs/sites/default/TECHNICAL%20DIVISION%20(TEC)/Controls%20and%20Interlocks%20CTRL/Supplier%20Documentation/Qioptic/FeturaDevManual-1.9.pdf">Zoom module Developer Guide V1.9</a>


The documentation provided by the manufacturer does not reflect
what the Windows software "Pulse" uses to communicate.
The communications were inspected using a signal analyser and 
it was noticed that undocumented commands are sent to the device
from "Pulse".

These kind of plausible commands were observed 
(plausible because the checksum corresponds to what
is expected):

['08', '0F', 'F0', 'B0', '04', '0F', 'F1', '03', '2B', 'E9']<br>
['08', '0F', 'F0', '90', '04', '03', '2B', '03', 'C2', '8E']<br>
['08', '0F', 'F0', '90', '24', '03', '2B', '02', '73', '5E']<br>
['08', '0F', 'F0', '90', '24', '03', '2B', '02', '9A', '85']<br>

The most frequent command is the status request instruction<br>
['08', '0F', 'F0', 'B0', '04', '0F', 'F1', '03', 'C4', '82'],<br>
which is documented. 

The interpretation of the reply, the status message, 
according to the developer's guide 
is in doubt, because the checksum returned by the unit seems to be always wrong.
Warnings are printed for this failed checksum when using a trace mask of 0x10 (ASYN_TRACE_FLOW)
the zoom module port.
